# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com).

I plan to solve the puzzles using Python 3, hopefully picking up some Python libraries along the way as they could come in useful.

Estimated time spent on the puzzles:

* [day 01](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1): ~20min
* [day 02](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2): ~15min
* [day 03](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3): ~20min
* [day 04](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4): ~25min
* [day 05](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5): ~20min
